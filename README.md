### About Our Project

ELECT is a free, open source, privacy focused tool that aggregates data about upcoming elections, local, state, and national Candidates and Representatives. We created 
ELECT as a React-based Progressive Web Application so that it would be available to the widest audience possible. The tool runs in any web broswer and can be saved as a 
application on a smart device. 

With the sanctity of privacy required to make democratic elections possible in mind, we decided to never store any data about anyone that ever uses the tool. All possible 
attempts have been made to hide user information in any API calls that were made to exclude the possibility of targetted advertisements and any sort of data collection.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
